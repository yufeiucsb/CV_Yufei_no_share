%\section*{Research Interests} 
%My research interest resides at the intersection of Compiler Technology and (Big) Data Analytics, with a focus on enabling Higher-Level Program Optimizations for data analytics and other data-intensive applications. My research pioneers the efforts of raising the level of program optimizations from implementations to algorithms, and from instructions to formulas. %, 
% algorithmic optimization are we want to enable automatic compiler-based algorithmic optimization  perspective of algorithm generation and selection, in terms of input sensitivity, parallelization, and redundancy elimination. My research involves various important algorithms, which are commonly used in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and other High-Performance Applications.
% I have recently focused on these problems in the context of parallel frameworks like shared-memory multi-core system, and the distributed system.
